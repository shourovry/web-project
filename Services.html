        <p> Ensuring the security of confidential business data including your customer’s sensitive personal and financial details requires constant attention. And though not every business demands the full-time commitment of an executive to oversee this function, small- to mid-sized businesses do need the same level of security and control capabilities already in place at larger corporations. While the resources for smaller organizations are less, the compliance and risk requirements are often the same as larger companies. This is where Virtual CISO services can play a role to deliver and streamline controls to meet risk and compliance objectives without the need to hire full-time staff members..</p>
